Notes Start:

If asked to do computational task and asked how long, you can't say 2ms without specifying the hardware. Instead we talk about how long based on input size

Point of complexity theory is to identify problems and then classify based on things like general runtime or Space complexity and communication complexity

First 2 lectures are Turing machine review - CSE 350 undergrad version of this class
