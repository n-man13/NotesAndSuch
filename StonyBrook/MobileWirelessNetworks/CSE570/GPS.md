GPS consists of at least 24 satellites
uses 3 satellites for location
use 1 more satellite for time sync
Generally uses at least 6 to get an estimate

Correlation = $1/5* \sum_{i=1}^5 s_i y_i$

The signal sent by GPS needs 
1. Good Auto-correlation
	1. correlate with itself well
2. Poor Cross-Correlation
	1. correlate with other signals badly
