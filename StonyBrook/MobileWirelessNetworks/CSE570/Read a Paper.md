Anatomy of a standard paper:
	Title and authors
		order of authors is important, based on contribution
	Abstract/summary
		Brief background of the subject 
		purpose of the study
		major findings
		relation between findings and field
	Intro
		Structure:
			What is the problem?
			Why is it important?
			Why is it a hard/challenging problem?
			Why have other approaches failed to solve it?
			What are the authors proposing?
	Materials and methods
		Should be detailed enough for others to replicate
		Often compressed and may need other papers to get the full picture
		can be skimmed over instead of reading in depth unless you are really interested
	Results
		How well proposed solution worked
		figures and tables help to show the data results
	Discussion
		
	Acknowledgements
	References
	Related papers

after first pass, write a summary, then go back and reread and double check

Reflection and criticism:
	Do you agree with rationale for setup
	did they perform appropriately
	were there enough experiments to support the finding

Spend a lot of time on the paper to properly understand it
how well can you explain the paper in 4-5 sentences
