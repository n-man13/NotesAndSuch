Dead Reckoning and Kalman Filter
Dead reckoning is the process of calculating the current position of a moving object, using a previously determined position, and incorporating estimates of speed, heading and elapsed time
Inertial Navigation System - INS
Applications of Dead Reckoning - Navigation, Health Sensing, Augmented Reality
Pedestrian dead reckoning is less reliable, as human movement is more erratic than cars
Gait Analysis
	Velocity
	Stride Length
	Step Length
	Stance phase
	Swing phase
	Cadence
[[Sensor Fusion]] is paramount to Dead Reckoning

[[Kalman Filter]] is the most popularly used filter for [[Sensor Fusion]]
