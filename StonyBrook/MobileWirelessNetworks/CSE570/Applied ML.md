Deep Learning inside Machine Learning inside Artificial Intelligence
Deep learning is neural networks with large amounts of data
Machine Learning uses statistical techniques to learn to do better at a task

supervised learning - labeled data
unsupervised - unlabeled data
reinforcement learning - learn with feedback/reward

Pattern recognition is science of making inferences on data
	classification vs regression
Having m classes, confusion matrix is of size $m*m$
use misclassification instead of false positive or false negative when dealing with more than 2 classes
main difference between ML vs Deep Learning is feature extraction by a person, where deep learning uses weights between layers to do both feature extraction and classification at the same time
