#concepts
cornerstone of IoT
merge data between different sensors to reduce noise and gain accuracy
Most common example is Self driving car
Lidar - time of flight measure - light sent, then reflected back and timed

Complementary sensor fusion - use different sensors to to get something that couldn't be got by 1 alone

Redundancy sensor fusion - backup incase one fails

Coordinated sensor fusion - using multiple to get a bit more from each

early fusion, sensors add to each other as soon as possible

late fusion - sensors double check each other and if there is intersection between 2 sensors

Kalman Filter - most commonly used filter to merge sensors
