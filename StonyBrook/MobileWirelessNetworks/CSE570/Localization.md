The capability to determine the location of an object
Device based - GPS
device free - camera, radar

positioning is global, localization is local

GPS consists of at least 24 satellites

Localization approachs:
	Proximity/ Identity based - near anchor with known location
	Lateration - Distance to known things
	Angulation - Angle to known things
	Fingerprinting - obtain signal strength to infer location
	Dead Reckoning - start from known location and using knowledge of velocity, calculate location
